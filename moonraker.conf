################## PANELDUE #######################

[paneldue]
serial: /dev/ttyS5
#   The serial port in which the PanelDue is connected.  This parameter
#   must be provided.
baud: 115200
#   The baud rate to connect at.  The default is 57600 baud.
machine_name: Voron 2.4
#   An optional unique machine name which displays on the PanelDue's
#   Header.  The default is "Klipper".
macros:
 LOAD_FILAMENT
 UNLOAD_FILAMENT
 PANELDUE_BEEP FREQUENCY=500 DURATION=1
#   A list of newline separated "macros" that are displayed in the
#   PanelDue's "macros" tab.  These can be gcode macros or simple
#   gcodes.  A macro may contain parameters.  The default is no
#   macros will be displayed by the PanelDue.
confirmed_macros:
  RESTART
  FIRMWARE_RESTART
  SHUTDOWN

#  Like the "macros" option, this list is added to the macros tab.
#  When one of these macros is executed the PanelDue will prompt
#  the user with a confirmation dialog.  The default is to include
#  RESTART and FIRMWARE_RESTART.


################## ATX #######################


# Control a relay providing power to the printer
[power printer]
type: gpio
#   The type of device.  Can be either gpio, klipper_device, rf,
#   tplink_smartplug, tasmota, shelly, homeseer, homeassistant, loxonev1,
#   smartthings, mqtt or hue.

pin: gpio74  # uses pin 74 on orange pi zero 2 = pin PC10

initial_state: off

bound_services: klipper
#   Important is the name printer and the attribute bound_services: klipper. Mainsail will use this power device to check for a "powered off" printer.
#   A newline separated list of services that are "bound" to the state of this
#   device.  When the device is powered on all bound services will be started.
#   When the device is powered off all bound services are stopped.
#
#   The items in this list are limited to those specified in the allow list,
#   see the [machine] configuration documentation for details.  Additionally,
#   the Moonraker service can not be bound to a power device.  Note that
#   service names are case sensitive.
#
#   The default is no services are bound to the device.

off_when_shutdown: True
#   If set to True the device will be powered off when Klipper enters
#   the "shutdown" state.  This option applies to all device types.
#   The default is False.

##timer: 
#    A time (in seconds) after which the device will power off after being.
#    switched on. This effectively turns the device into a  momentary switch.
#    This option is available for gpio, klipper_device, tplink_smartplug,
#    shelly, and tasmota devices.  The timer may be a floating point value
#    for gpio types, it should be an integer for all other types.  The
#    default is no timer is set.

off_when_shutdown_delay: 5
#   If "off_when_shuoi, que horas tem o rango aitdown" is set, this option specifies the amount of time
#   (in seconds) to wait before turning the device off. Default is 0 seconds.

#on_when_job_queued: True
#   If set to True the device will power on if a job is queued while the
#   device is off.  This allows for an automated "upload, power on, and
#   print" approach directly from the slicer, see the configuration example
#   below for details. The default is False.

##locked_while_printing: False
#   If True, locks the device so that the power cannot be changed while the
#   printer is printing. This is useful to avert an accidental shutdown to
#   the printer's power.  The default is False.

restart_klipper_when_powered: True
#   If set to True, Moonraker will schedule a "FIRMWARE_RESTART" to command
#   after the device has been powered on. If it isn't possible to immediately
#   schedule a firmware restart (ie: Klippy is disconnected), the restart
#   will be postponed until Klippy reconnects and reports that startup is
#   complete.  Prior to scheduling the restart command the power device will
#   always check Klippy's state.  If Klippy reports that it is "ready", the
#   FIRMWARE_RESTART will be aborted as unnecessary.
#   The default is False.

##restart_delay: 1.
#   If "restart_klipper_when_powered" is set, this option specifies the amount
#   of time (in seconds) to delay the restart.  Default is 1 second.
